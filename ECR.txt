Bugs:
- when I try to start a timed recording for the following day - say 6 am tomorrow morning.  If it's not past midnight, the recording starts immediately. 

Requests:
- Merge tracks (around silence)
- Display sound level value somewhere
- Shutdown system after recording

Interface/functionality
- Time lines or other time indication along the window
- Stereo, show L/R channels seperately  (Quad?)
- Color tracks in bottom wav
- Save confirmation
- Edit splits, Split point location adjust
- show VU meter/LEDs after recording.

New functionality
- CD TEXT
- Calc tempo (b.p.m.)
- Loudness balancing (max level w/o clipping)
- Input level control
- Fade IN/OUT on tracks
- Remove 'unwanted' data (zero samples)
- Crossfade two tracks that are not adjacent
- Save/load 'peak' files
- Add silence to start/end of tracks
